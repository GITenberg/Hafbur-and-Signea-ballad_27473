5</span>HAFBUR AND SIGNE</h2>
<p>Young Hafbur King and Sivard King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived in bitter enmity;<br />
&rsquo;Twas Signe proud that caused their feud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of maidens all the fairest she.</p>
<p>It was youthful Hafbur King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Awaked at midnight with a bound,<br />
And full of dread he straightway said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wondrous dream to all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methought I was in heaven&rsquo;s domain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within that place so fair to view,<br />
And held to my breast my loved one prest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When down we fell the cloudlets through.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>And there sat all the Dames and maids<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And little heeded what he said;<br />
But lent an ear his mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas she alone attention paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son do thou to the mountain go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And look that thou dost go with speed;<br />
The Daughter demand of Elfin land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she to thee thy dream will rede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was young King Hafbur bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his left hand he took his blade,<br />
And away he hied to the mountain&rsquo;s side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek the lovely elfin maid.</p>
<p>With his fingers white he thrice tapped light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the mountain&rsquo;s side so green;<br />
The daughter of Elle lay awake, and well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could guess what did that tapping mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, daughter fair of Elfland&rsquo;s King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom here I see in costly wede!<br />
I beg for love of the God above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou to me my dream wilt rede.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Methought I was in Heaven&rsquo;s domain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within that place so fair to view,<br />
And held to my breast my loved one prest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When down I sank the cloudlets through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy dreaming thou wast in heaven, doth mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou shalt win the damsel proud;<br />
But that thou shalt die for her is shown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By thy falling through the little cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if for me it destined be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To win the maid for whom I sigh,<br />
I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er complain if Fate ordain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That afterwards for her I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Hafbur lets his hair grow long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And maiden&rsquo;s clothes he caused be made;<br />
And away he rode to the high abode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Siward King, to learn to braid.</p>
<p>For himself he clothes has caused be made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All such as high born damsels wear;<br />
Then away rode he o&rsquo;er hill and lea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek King Siward&rsquo;s daughter fair.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>When he had reached the castle yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In haste he smoothed his array;<br />
To the hall of state where ladies wait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And maids, then swift he takes his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hail to you, ye lovely dames,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hail ye, maids of high degree!<br />
And hail the child that&rsquo;s Signild styled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dane King&rsquo;s child, if here she be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail Signild, daughter of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who here art spinning silken thread;<br />
Sir Hafbur me has sent to thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou mayst teach me how to braid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou dost come by Hafbur sent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A welcome guest thou here shalt be;<br />
What I can impart of the braiding art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll willingly impart to thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whate&rsquo;er I know of the braiding art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll willingly to thee disclose;<br />
And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with my best loved maid repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;O I have eat with princely maids,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And by their sides have often lain;<br />
I should pine, I trow, if bid to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bed with one of the servant train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well do not grieve my pretty may!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll do thee no disgrace nor harm;<br />
And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou shalt sleep within my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there sat all the damsels proud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with their work dispatch they made,<br />
Save Hafbur alone, the King&rsquo;s good son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who with his needle often play&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>They sewed the hart, and they sewed the hind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In good green wood that ran about;<br />
Of cup of gold he scarce got hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Hafbur all the wine drunk out.</p>
<p>In came the wicked servant maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In evil hour in came she:<br />
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er I&rsquo;ve been I ne&rsquo;er have seen<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A maid know less of broidery.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;A damsel fair I ne&rsquo;er have seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who understood of stitching less;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er on earth a maid of birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink wine with greater eagerness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out and said the wicked maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud with her sharp voice she spake:<br />
&ldquo;No maid I&rsquo;ve viewed of noble blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such draughts of power ever take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never sews so small a seam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with her needle she doth stop;<br />
No cup so great she gets, but straight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She drains it to the bottom drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two eyes she has, and eyes so bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In high born maid I ne&rsquo;er have seen;<br />
And she doth bear of hands a pair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cast of iron seem, I ween.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, thou servant maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy jeers at me why dost thou throw?<br />
Thou needst not fear or blame or sneer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From me, however thou may&rsquo;st sew.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Forego thy scoffs, forego thy jeers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And do not watch me in such guise;<br />
I thee don&rsquo;t mark on thy hand&rsquo;s work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever way I turn my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Hafbur then the King&rsquo;s good son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sew at length with zeal began;<br />
And he sewed hart and hind with art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en as they run pursued by man.</p>
<p>He lilies sews, and roses bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds upon the bough he sews;<br />
At his address they all express<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprise, they&rsquo;d him by no means lose.</p>
<p>And on sewed they till end of day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And till some part of night was fled;<br />
With drowsy brows the proud maids rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It lists them now to go to bed.</p>
<p>So late it was at nightly tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down fell the dew o&rsquo;er hill and mead;<br />
Then lists it her proud Signild fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the rest to bed to speed.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;O where shall I a bed procure?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Hafbur then, the King&rsquo;s good son.<br />
&ldquo;O thou shalt rest in chamber best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With me the bolsters blue upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud Signild foremost went, and stepped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The threshold of her chamber o&rsquo;er;<br />
With secret glee came Hafbur, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had never been so glad before.</p>
<p>Then lighted they the waxen lights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fairly twisted were the same.<br />
Behind, behind, with ill at mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wicked servant maiden came.</p>
<p>The lights were out, the train retired,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They thought that they were all alone;<br />
His upper wede the knight with speed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did off, then bright his faulchion shone.</p>
<p>King Hafbur with delighted heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the bed himself has flung;<br />
I tell to ye for verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That as he fell his hauberk rung.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Then out and spake proud Signelil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She could not wonder half enough:<br />
&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve been born no maid has worn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have known, a sarke so rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand upon young Hafbur&rsquo;s breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shone with ruddy gold she laid:<br />
&ldquo;To me make known why are not grown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your breasts like those of another maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis custom in my father&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For maids to mount and ride to fight;<br />
My breasts not growing more, is owing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the chafe of my hauberk tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there reclined the night so long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The youthful hero and the may;<br />
They talking kept and nothing slept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For in their hearts so much there lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, proud Signild fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since all alone ourselves we find,<br />
Tell me the truth, who is the youth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For whom most stands your maiden mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;O there is none within the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For whom I feel the least inclined,<br />
Save Hafbur young, whose deeds are sung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he for me is not designed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save Hafbur young whom it has been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These eyes hard fortune ne&rsquo;er to see;<br />
I&rsquo;ve heard alone his bugle blown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to and fro the Ting rides he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it is prince Hafbur young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom them dost hold at heart so dear,<br />
Straight turn your face and on him gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he does lie to thee so near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou art he, why dost thou seek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A princely maiden to inveigle?<br />
In manly sort to Siward&rsquo;s court<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why cam&rsquo;st thou not with hawk and
beagle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O maiden, to your father&rsquo;s house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long since I came with hawk and hound;<br />
But my desire he met with ire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in my ear his scoffs resound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>All, all the time that they did talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They thought that quite alone were they;<br />
But one stood near, and lent an ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To every word that they did say.</p>
<p>Shame, shame befall the wicked maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas she brought much mishap to pass;<br />
She sly removed the sword approved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Hafbur, and the new cuirass.</p>
<p>When she had removed the sword approved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hafbur&rsquo;s good cuirass beside;<br />
To the hall away where Sivard lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wicked maiden swiftly hied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, awake, good Sivard King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much of sleep is in thy head!<br />
Prince Hafbur know is lying now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Signild fair in silken bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O young Prince Hafbur is not here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is false what thou hast told;<br />
To the Eastern main his way he&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;en,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Russ and Finman fight to hold.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;So hold thy peace, thou wicked wench,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor lying tongue &rsquo;gainst Signe turn;<br />
Ere morn shall dye the Eastern sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy foul slander thou shalt burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, my noble Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe me all my words are true!<br />
For see, I have his polished glaive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his cuirass of beaming blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So wroth grew Sivard at the sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud around he &rsquo;gan to shout:<br />
&ldquo;Upstand ye all my merry men tall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For here is come a Kemp so stout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take ye brand and shield in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And look ye wield them both aright;<br />
Unto our home is Hafbur come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unasked by me, the hard necked wight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the door they struck with power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With shield and faulchion struck they hard:<br />
&ldquo;Come out, come out, young Bear,&rdquo; they shout,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come out unto the castle yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>When that heard she, proud Signelil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lily hands she fell to wring:<br />
&ldquo;Ah! dost not hear, Prince Hafbur dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How they for thee are clamouring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Praise be to Hafbur, princely youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against a host he made a stand;<br />
They could not all the youth enthrall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till snapped the bed post in his hand.</p>
<p>They Hafbur took, and him they placed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In shackles strong and newly made;<br />
But them in twain he burst amain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As had they only been of lead.</p>
<p>Then raised the ancient maid her voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And curs&egrave;d counsel came from her:<br />
&ldquo;Bind yonder Bear with Signe&rsquo;s hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hand or foot he will not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirs, straightway bind ye Hafbur&rsquo;s hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one of Signe&rsquo;s silken hairs;<br />
That little hair he will not dare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To break, such love for her he bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>And they took two of Signild&rsquo;s hairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bound with them his mighty hands;<br />
Such love possest the Hero&rsquo;s breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not burst the tiny bands.</p>
<p>Then out and spake proud Signelil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adown her cheeks the tears ran fast:<br />
&ldquo;O Hafbur tear the paltry hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Signe&rsquo;s free consent thou hast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they placed Hafbur, son of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast bounden in the castle hall;<br />
Both maid and dame to see him came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his own maiden first of all.</p>
<p>They Hafbur took, the son of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in strong irons him they laid;<br />
In woeful mood before him stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full speedily his loving maid.</p>
<p>To him with burning tears she spake:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If Hafbur thou consent will give,<br />
My good aunts three on bended knee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall intercede that thou shalt live.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;My father threatens steadfastly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hang thee on the oaken bough,<br />
Upon the moor at early hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before again the sun shall glow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered young King Hafbur bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in high wrath the Hero spake:<br />
&ldquo;Too light I heed my life, to need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That women prayer for me should make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, Signild, hear, do thou show clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This day for me thy love is great;<br />
When in the string thou see me swing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within thy bower burn thee straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered him proud Signelil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With streaming eyes and heaving breast:<br />
&ldquo;By the God above, my dearest love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll grant to thee thy last
request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From out the gate they Hafbur led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s good son, at solemn pace;<br />
For him sore cried all him that eyed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So hard and stern they thought his case.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>And when they reached the verdant plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he the gallant youth should die;<br />
He begged he might have a short respite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d prove his Signe&rsquo;s constancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye hang up my mantle red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Sivard King the same may see;<br />
He may repent, and yet prevent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Hafbur&rsquo;s hanging on a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Signild proud the mantle saw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sight it pierced her like a knife:<br />
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;it vails me
nought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tarry longer here in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called together her maids with speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concealing well her bosom&rsquo;s woe:<br />
&ldquo;To have some play we&rsquo;ll wend our way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the lofty chamber now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out and spake proud Signelil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She spake in stern determined guise:<br />
&ldquo;This day I will my own self kill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hafbur join in Paradise.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;If any one in our band has helped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring him to his death so foul,<br />
Shall rue his wrong when we ere long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall burn together all to coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many there are in this palace fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom now the death of Hafbur gladdens;<br />
But venge will I their cruelty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This moment on their plighted maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then fire she set to her bower high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire so hastily it blazed;<br />
How well she loved to all she proved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who on that conflagration gazed.</p>
<p>It was Hafbur, son of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er his shoulder blade he cast his sight;<br
/>
Of Signe good the bower stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enwrapt in one tremendous light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take ye down my mantle red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let it lie upon the plain;<br />
Within my breast if I possessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten lives to beg them I&rsquo;d disdain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>King Sivard out of the window looked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his mind such horror came;<br />
For Hafbur he saw hang on a tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Signild&rsquo;s bower enwrapt in flame.</p>
<p>Outspake amain the little foot swain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he a mantle red had on:<br />
&ldquo;Now burns in bower the beauteous flower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her fair maidens, every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spake grey Sivard the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face with paleness ghastly all:<br />
&ldquo;A fate so dour as this I&rsquo;m sure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did never princes two befall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I before had heard or known<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of love was half so great,<br />
I&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er, I swear, have vext the pair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the wealth of Denmark&rsquo;s state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run some of ye to Signild&rsquo;s bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strive to bear my child relief;<br />
Let others race to the gallows place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Hafbur bold was ne&rsquo;er a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>And when they came to Signe&rsquo;s bower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All burnt they found the Lady fair;<br />
When out of breath they reached the heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hafbur was hanging dead in air.</p>
<p>They Hafbur took, the son of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round him linen white they roll&rsquo;d;<br />
And him they laid beside his maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a tear in Christian mould.</p>
<p>And then the wicked maid they took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to a death so horrid doomed;<br />
A fitting bed for her they made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alive the wretch they have entombed.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
